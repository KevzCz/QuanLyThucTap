# Project Context and Coding Guidelines
- There are 4 roles in this project: Student, BCN, GV, PDT
- Follow the existing coding style and conventions used in the project and if seen anything that is not following the conventions (i.e variable naming, file structure, icons, statuses, UI, frontend - backend, etc.), please fix them.
- Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.
- Ensure that your code is efficient and optimized for performance.
- Don't use too much comments.
- If you see comments in a file, please ensure to remove them if they are no longer necessary.
- Automatically continue the conversation until I say "stop" or you've finished checking everything.
When you're done making changes, please ensure that there are no errors in all files. Then always run 'bun run bun_script' to start both the front end and back end.
